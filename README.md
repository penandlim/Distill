# Distil

* Distill is a Chrome extension that uses machine-learning to block images and text that may be harmful to the end user. Our aim is to make the web accessible for all audiences to use without the fear of encountering unwanted content

* We used a combination of JavaScript, the Clarifai API, CSS, and HTML to bring our project to completion. The use of such a wide variety of resources helped us to create something incredible

* Check us out here! Distill's Github

* Test our program's spidey senses here! distilluw.tumblr.com (Make sure you have the extension first!)
